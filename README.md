<!-- Reflections for the end of the project

I think this project has been useful in terms of getting actual practice building a website
and learning how to use different types of lists for different situations, such as using 
an unordered list on the index page to have the links to the recipes on different lines, 
rather than just one after another.

I think the main thing I got practice at with this project is using git, and adding/committing 
files regularly. I still need practice writing more elaborate commit messages, but I feel 
a lot more confident using git now than I did before. -->
